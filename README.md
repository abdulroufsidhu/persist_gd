# **Persist**  
### *The Universal Save System for Godot 4.x*  

**Effortlessly save and load game states** with a single line of code. Persist offers a **thread-safe, binary-encrypted** solution designed for production-ready games.  

```gdscript
# Save your game with one call
Persist.save(1)  

# Load it back just as easily  
Persist.load(1)
```

## **Why Persist?**  
- ðŸš€ **Competes with Unity/Unreal save systems** â€“ All the features you need, built for Godot.  
- ðŸ”’ **Security-first** â€“ AES-256 encryption and checksum validation.  
- ðŸ“¦ **Lightweight** â€“ No dependencies, just pure GDScript performance.

## **Quick Start**  
1. Add `persist.gd` as an autoload (`Persist`)  
2. Inherit from `Saveable` in nodes you want to persist:  
   ```gdscript
   extends CharacterBody2D
   class_name Player
   inherits Saveable  # <-- That's it!
   ```  
3. Implement `save_data()` and `load_data()` (see [examples](link-to-examples)).

## **Roadmap**  
- [ ] Cloud save integration (Steam/Google Play)  
- [ ] Savefile screenshot thumbnails  
- [ ] Delta save optimizations
